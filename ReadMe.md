<h1>Disaster Tweets</h1>
A lot of people now are using smartphones, which enables people to easily be on social media.<br>

Twitter uniquely provides its users the opportunity to discover what's happening in the world.<br>

According to Twitter’s latest figures from the fourth quarter of 2020, the platform boasts 192 million daily active users (Twitter, 2021).<br>

Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programmatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).<br>

In this project, I built a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones aren’t.
